I work on computational systems that combine artificial intelligence, 3D representation, and decentralized infrastructure.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Boston University and a Master of Science in Blockchain Technology from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

My experience includes generative AI, spatial representations, multi-agent systems, decentralized applications, and systems-level design. I enjoy exploring interdisciplinary problems and translating emerging models and algorithms into practical, scalable tools across design, data, and digital environments.
